## About

A simple practice front-page for a company of my choice.  I chose the Dirty Burger business from the show Trailer Park Boys.  This project is mainly designed to test my flexbox and/or grid layout skills in CSS.

## Technology

This webpage was created in HTML, using CSS and Git versioning technology in VSCode.
