## About

A simple practice front-page for a company of my choice.  I chose the Dirty Burger business from the show Trailer Park Boys.  This project is mainly designed to test my flexbox and/or grid layout skills in CSS.  
Completing this webpage has taught me a lot about CSS precendence order, and use of flexboxes, which of the two layout skills specified was the one I'd struggled with most before.

It should be noted that this website is intended as only a nod to a show that I like and is not anything serious.  I don't own any of the images used.

## Technology

This webpage was created in HTML, using CSS and Git versioning technology in VSCode.
